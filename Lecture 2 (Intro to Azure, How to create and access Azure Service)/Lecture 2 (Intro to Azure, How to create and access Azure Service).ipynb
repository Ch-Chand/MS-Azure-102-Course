One option is to store the key in an environment variable or a configuration file where the application is deployed, but this approach leaves the key vulnerable to unauthorized access. A better approach when developing applications on Azure is to store the key securely in Azure Key Vault, and provide access to the key through a managed identity (in other words, a user account used by the application itself).\n",
