    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) empowers software to decipher human language. Through Azure AI Language service, developers can not only classify text but also identify sentiments, languages, and user-defined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand different classification projects.\n",
    "- Learn to develop custom text classification projects.\n",
    "- Discover ways to label, train, and deploy your model."

    "## 1. Understanding Types of Classification Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom text classification, using the Azure AI Language service, involves assigning developer-defined labels to text. For instance, a video game's description can be labeled as \"Adventure\", \"Action\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary custom text classification projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single label classification:** One class is assigned to a file. E.g., a video game can either be \"Adventure\" or \"Strategy\", but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple label classification:** A file can have more than one class. So, a video game might be both \"Adventure\" and \"Strategy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to decide the type of classification project during its creation. Moreover, understanding the differences between single vs. multiple label projects is essential in labeling data, evaluating the model's accuracy, and deciding on the API payload for tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Data for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For single label projects, one class is assigned to each file. However, for multiple label projects, a file can have more than one label. Properly labeling the data, especially in multiple label projects, will determine the success of your model. It's imperative to maintain a quality dataset that is clear, varied, and representative of possible inputs for effective learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluating and Improving Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, inaccuracies in classification can occur, such as false positives and false negatives. Azure AI Language provides metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall:** This checks out of all the actual labels, how many were identified correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision:** It calculates how many predicted labels are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1 Score:** Combines recall and precision to provide a single score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the errors, you can refine your model, ensuring better performance with each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Building Text Classification Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Azure AI Language, developers can create custom text classification projects. The steps involved are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Labels: Determine possible labels for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tag Data:** Properly label existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Train Model:** Use labeled data to train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **View Model:** After training, assess the model's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improve Model:** Identify errors and enhance model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deploy Model:** Make the trained model accessible via API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classify Text:** Use the deployed model to classify text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, data can be categorized into Training and Testing datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Dataset:** Used to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing Dataset:** Used to verify the model's performance post-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides options for Automatic or Manual split for these datasets, catering to different project needs."

    "# Guide to Create a Text Classifier with Azure AI Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This guide will help you understand how to create a text classifier using Azure AI Language. The Language service offers several NLP capabilities, and among these, custom text classification is a powerful tool. Let's walk through each step in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. **Set Up Azure AI Language Service Resource**\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the Azure portal and sign in with your Microsoft account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for Azure AI services and select to create a Language Service resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the Custom text classification & extraction feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure your new resource with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subscription: Your Azure subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource group: A unique name\n",
    "\n",
    "- Region: Any available\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name: A unique resource name\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pricing tier: Standard S\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storage account: New storage account\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storage account name: A unique name\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storage account type: Standard LRS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responsible AI notice: Checked\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieve Language Resource Key and Endpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the resource group in the Azure portal and choose the Azure AI Language resource.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a new project and configure the given options.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Label Your Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your project is created, start labeling (or tagging) your data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Assign each article the appropriate class and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train Your Model**\n",

    "Navigate to Training jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a training job and name your model (e.g., ClassifyArticles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate Your Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Review model performance metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "8. Deploy Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Deploying model from the left panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a deployment and provide the necessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Test Your Model using Azure Cloud Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to go to option \"Test Deployment* and enter the text and and test your model.\n",
